# Language Translator
This is a simple language translator that can translate text from English to Morse code or binary code, or from Morse code or binary code to English.

You will be prompted to choose the language to translate from and to, and to enter the text to translate. Simply follow the prompts to translate your text.

## Using the Program
When the program starts, you will be prompted to choose a source language and a target language. The available languages are:

English, Morse or Bits

Enter the name of the language you want to translate from and to, using the correct spelling and capitalization.

Next, you will be prompted to enter the text you want to translate. Type your text and press enter.

The program will then translate your text and print the translation on the screen.

You will then be prompted to choose whether you want to translate something else. If you choose "yes", the program will start over and, you can enter new text to translate. If you choose "no", the program will exit.
## Limitations
This program can only translate between the three languages listed above. It is not able to translate between any other languages. Additionally, the program is only able to translate individual characters, and not entire words or phrases. This means that the translations may not always be accurate, particularly for longer pieces of text.
